# Brain Network

*Brain Network* is a visual design project aimed at taking an artistic approach to synapses communicating in a vast network of neurons. Accepting any 3D `obj` model, the system parses the mesh to strategically place neurons to make a neural network that resembles the input model during the pre-processing step. After creating the network, nodes are placed on the network, traversing the neural network in 3D space in a spectacle of colors relative to their own position.
